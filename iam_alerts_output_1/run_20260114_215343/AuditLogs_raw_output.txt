Thought: I have received the audit log data. Now I need to process this data to identify security-relevant patterns and generate alerts according to the specified rules and schema.

I will go through each user and service, analyze their events, and then create alerts.

Here's a plan:
1.  **Parse the log data**: Extract relevant fields like user, timestamp, operation, IP, device, service, correlation ID, and result.
2.  **Group events by user/service and correlation ID**: This will help in correlating related events.
3.  **Apply detection rules**:
    *   **Password Reset Patterns**: Look for failed attempts followed by success, self-service resets from multiple IPs.
    *   **MFA Modifications**: Check for MFA updates, especially by other users or multiple devices.
    *   **Group Operations**: Identify failed group additions, successful additions.
    *   **License/User Updates**: Look for license changes, especially for privileged accounts.
    *   **Access Patterns**: Analyze IP changes for a single user.
    *   **System Service Actions**: Monitor service principal activities.
    *   **Device Registration**: Aggregate device update events.
4.  **Determine Severity**: Assign CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, or INFORMATIONAL based on the rules.
5.  **Construct Alert Objects**: Populate all fields as per the `Alert` and `AlertDetails` schema.
6.  **Generate Final JSON Output**: Combine all alerts into the `AlertResponse` schema.

Let's start processing the data user by user and then service by service.

**Users to process:**
*   pragyan.behera@Yash.com
*   dhiyaneswaran.s@Yash.com

I will maintain a list of alerts and then format them at the end.
I need to keep track of unique users for `total_users_analyzed`.

Let's process each user's events first.

**User: pragyan.behera@Yash.com**
*   Event: `Settings_GetSettingsAsync` (success)
*   Severity: INFORMATIONAL (Routine operation)
*   Details: Single IP, SYSTEM service.

**User: dhiyaneswaran.s@Yash.com**
*   Event: `Update user` (success) by `Azure MFA StrongAuthenticationService`
*   Severity: INFORMATIONAL (Routine MFA device updates, assuming this is a self-update or system-initiated update)
*   Details: No IP, N/A device.

**User: prasant.morusu@Yash.com**
*   Events: 6 `Settings_GetSettingsAsync` (success)
*   IPs: 4.194.47.148, 4.194.47.155, 4.194.47.151 (3 different IPs)
*   Time Span: 143 seconds
*   Rule: Access from >3 IPs in < 5 minutes (CRITICAL) - This user has 3 IPs in 143 seconds (less than 5 minutes). This matches the CRITICAL rule.
*   Severity: CRITICAL
*   Confidence: 95 (Strong match to rule)

**User: vikram.chavan@yash.com**
*   Event: `Update user` (success) by `Azure MFA StrongAuthenticationService`
*   Severity: INFORMATIONAL (Routine MFA device updates)
*   Details: No IP, N/A device.

**User: sarita.lad@Yash.com**
*   Events: `Add owner to group`, `Add member to group`, `Add owner to group` (all success)
*   IP: 2a01:111:f402:f0e7::f152 (single IP)
*   Service: Office 365 SharePoint Online
*   Severity: INFORMATIONAL (Successful group operations)
*   Confidence: 70 (Routine, but group changes are worth noting)

**User: nagavvss.kumar@Yash.com**
*   **Group Management**: 4 `Settings_GetSettingsAsync` (success) from 4.194.47.156. INFORMATIONAL.
*   **User Management**:
    *   2 `Update user` by `Azure MFA StrongAuthenticationService` (success). INFORMATIONAL.
    *   `Update user`, `Update StsRefreshTokenValidFrom Timestamp`, `Change user password`, `Update PasswordProfile` by `ConnectSyncProvisioning_INHYDADCON10_16ff3c35c0a6` (success). INFORMATIONAL (System service actions, routine sync).
    *   `Reset password (self-service)` (success) by `My Signins`. INFORMATIONAL.
    *   `Update StsRefreshTokenValidFrom Timestamp`, `Reset user password`, `Update PasswordProfile`, `Update user`, `Update PasswordProfile` by `Microsoft password reset service` (success). INFORMATIONAL.
    *   `User started password reset` (success) from 4.194.47.150. INFORMATIONAL.
    *   `User reset password` (success) from 163.116.214.93.
    *   `Reset password (self-service)` (failure) from N/A. MEDIUM (Single failed password reset).
    *   `User started password reset` (success) from 4.194.47.158.

    Let's correlate the password reset events for `nagavvss.kumar@Yash.com`:
    *   2026-01-14T11:04:03.2700053Z: `User started password reset` (success) from 4.194.47.158 (Correlation ID: 455159d8-d4f8-4fa3-a558-264b9914ac65)
    *   2026-01-14T11:04:04.6189556Z: `Reset password (self-service)` (failure) (Correlation ID: 455159d8-d4f8-4fa3-a558-264b9914ac65)
    *   This is a single failed password reset. Rule: MEDIUM: Single failed password reset.
    *   Then, a successful password reset:
        *   2026-01-14T11:04:45.81666Z: `User started password reset` (success) from 4.194.47.150 (Correlation ID: cbf15a86-a967-4b27-adb0-ae5bd0c9a07c)
        *   2026-01-14T11:04:47.3487547Z: `Reset password (self-service)` (success) (Correlation ID: cbf15a86-a967-4b27-adb0-ae5bd0c9a07c)
        *   Also, `User reset password` (success) from 163.116.214.93 (Correlation ID: 9062dd04-e28d-4938-98c9-2363a15b5a8b) at 2026-01-14T11:04:45Z.
        *   And a series of `Microsoft password reset service` operations (Correlation ID: a3ab0487-f28f-47dd-bdbc-9f003ec0066b) around the same time.

    Let's analyze the password resets for `nagavvss.kumar@Yash.com` more closely:
    *   **Failed SSPR**:
        *   `User started password reset` (success) from `4.194.47.158` at `11:04:03` (ID: `455159d8-d4f8-4fa3-a558-264b9914ac65`)
        *   `Reset password (self-service)` (failure) at `11:04:04` (ID: `455159d8-d4f8-4fa3-a558-264b9914ac65`)
        *   This is a single failed password reset. Severity: MEDIUM. Confidence: 80.
    *   **Successful SSPR**:
        *   `User started password reset` (success) from `4.194.47.150` at `11:04:45` (ID: `cbf15a86-a967-4b27-adb0-ae5bd0c9a07c`)
        *   `Reset password (self-service)` (success) at `11:04:47` (ID: `cbf15a86-a967-4b27-adb0-ae5bd0c9a07c`)
        *   This is a successful self-service reset from a single IP. Severity: INFORMATIONAL. Confidence: 70.
    *   **Concurrent Password Changes**:
        *   `User reset password` (success) from `163.116.214.93` at `11:04:45Z` (ID: `9062dd04-e28d-4938-98c9-2363a15b5a8b`)
        *   At almost the same time (`11:04:45` to `11:04:47`), the SSPR from `4.194.47.150` is happening.
        *   This looks like concurrent password changes from different sources (SSPR + another "User reset password" from a different IP).
        *   Rule: HIGH: Concurrent password changes from different sources (SSPR + AD Sync). The "User reset password" from 163.116.214.93 is not explicitly AD Sync, but it's a different source/IP than the SSPR. This is a strong indicator.
        *   Severity: HIGH. Confidence: 90.
    *   **System-initiated password change**:
        *   `Change user password` by `ConnectSyncProvisioning_INHYDADCON10_16ff3c35c0a6` at `11:04:55` (ID: `88b4ac7e-8399-4bcc-8871-5ae23e414bc3`). This is a routine sync operation. INFORMATIONAL.

    For `nagavvss.kumar@Yash.com`, I will generate 3 alerts:
    1.  INFORMATIONAL for `Settings_GetSettingsAsync`
    2.  MEDIUM for single failed SSPR.
    3.  HIGH for concurrent password changes from different IPs/sources.
    4.  INFORMATIONAL for successful MFA updates.
    5.  INFORMATIONAL for system-initiated password changes.

I need to ensure `time_delta_seconds` is calculated correctly for grouped events. For single events, it's 0. For grouped events, it's `last_event_timestamp - first_event_timestamp`.
Also, `ip_addresses` and `correlation_ids` should be unique lists for grouped alerts.
`operation` should be a comma-separated string of unique operations for grouped alerts.
`device_info` should be a comma-separated string of unique device info for grouped alerts.

Let's re-check the `prasant.morusu@Yash.com` alert.
Events:
*   2026-01-14T11:12:27.8237416Z (IP: 4.194.47.148, ID: fae23c06-7083-4fc4-993a-d0a9e0d0f2f2)

First event: 2026-01-14T11:10:03.8390086Z
Last event: 2026-01-14T11:12:27.8237416Z
Time delta: 143.984733 seconds (approx 144 seconds).
Unique IPs: ["4.194.47.148", "4.194.47.155", "4.194.47.151"] - 3 IPs.
Rule: Access from >3 IPs in < 5 minutes (CRITICAL). This is 3 IPs in < 5 minutes. So it matches.

Let's re-check `nagavvss.kumar@Yash.com` - Concurrent Password Changes.
Events involved:
*   `User reset password` (success) from `163.116.214.93` at `2026-01-14T11:04:45Z` (ID: `9062dd04-e28d-4938-98c9-2363a15b5a8b`)
*   `User started password reset` (success) from `4.194.47.150` at `2026-01-14T11:04:45.81666Z` (ID: `cbf15a86-a967-4b27-adb0-ae5bd0c9a07c`)
*   `Reset password (self-service)` (success) at `2026-01-14T11:04:47.3487547Z` (ID: `cbf15a86-a967-4b27-adb0-ae5bd0c9a07c`)
*   Other events related to `Microsoft password reset service` (ID: `a3ab0487-f28f-47dd-bdbc-9f003ec0066b`) from `11:04:47.1354453Z` to `11:04:47.325454Z`.

First event: 2026-01-14T11:04:45Z
Last event: 2026-01-14T11:04:47.3487547Z
Time delta: 2.3487547 seconds.
Unique IPs: ["163.116.214.93", "4.194.47.150"] - 2 IPs.
Operations: `User reset password`, `User started password reset`, `Reset password (self-service)`, `Update StsRefreshTokenValidFrom Timestamp`, `Reset user password`, `Update PasswordProfile`, `Update user`.
This clearly fits "Concurrent password changes from different sources (SSPR + AD Sync)" or at least "different sources/IPs". HIGH severity.

Let's re-check `sagar.aluri@yash.com` - Unusual Access Pattern - Different Subnets.
Events:
*   `Add group` from `52.123.178.56` at `2026-01-14T11:04:07.3894101Z` (ID: `12ca860a-fb18-4d9d-8bb8-eb4fd2c3cb3b`)
*   `Add member to group` from `52.112.54.109` at `2026-01-14T11:04:35.3653475Z` (ID: `ea26c916-c24b-4c79-8c6d-e122f03995a2`)
First event: 2026-01-14T11:04:07.3894101Z
Last event: 2026-01-14T11:04:35.3653475Z
Time delta: 27.976 seconds.
Unique IPs: ["52.112.54.109", "52.123.178.56"]
Subnets: 52.112.54.x and 52.123.178.x are indeed different subnets.
Time delta is 27 seconds, which is < 60 seconds.
Rule: Access from 2 different subnets in < 60 seconds (MEDIUM). This matches.

All looks good. I will now construct the final JSON output.
The `generated_at` field should be the current timestamp. I'll use `2026-01-14T11:16:38.5757728Z` as the latest timestamp from the logs for consistency, or a current timestamp. The schema says `generated_at` type string, so I'll use the current time when generating the response.
`log_type` is "Azure AD Audit".
`total_users_analyzed` is 22.
I will ensure all `details` fields are correctly populated.
For `operation` in `AlertDetails`, if there are multiple unique operations, I will list them as a comma-separated string.
For `ip_addresses` and `correlation_ids`, I will ensure they are unique lists.
For `device_info`, if there are multiple unique devices, I will list them as a comma-separated string. If N/A, I will use "N/A".

Final check on `device_info` for grouped alerts:
*   `nagavvss.kumar@Yash.com` - Concurrent Password Changes: Devices are "Naga V V S S Kumar K", "N/A". So, "Naga V V S S Kumar K, N/A".
*   `ashok.nimmagadda@yash.com` - Successful SSPR and System Updates: Devices are "Ashok Kumar Nimmagadda", "N/A". So, "Ashok Kumar Nimmagadda, N/A".
*   `sagar.aluri@yash.com` - Unusual Access Pattern - Different Subnets: Devices are "N/A", "Business and Industry Consulting @ Americas". So, "N/A, Business and Industry Consulting @ Americas".
*   `Device Registration Service`: Devices are "YISC1101571LT", "YH1102151LT", "YH1004605LT", "YISC1012341LT". So, "YISC1101571LT, YH1102151LT, YH1004605LT, YISC1012341LT".
*   `ConnectSyncProvisioning_INHYDADCON10_16ff3c35c0a6`: Devices are "BG2-BU2", "Panasonicprojectyashteam", "YASH Updates - US Immigration", "LinkedinSalesNav_Users", "BG4-BU7". So, "BG2-BU2, Panasonicprojectyashteam, YASH Updates - US Immigration, LinkedinSalesNav_Users, BG4-BU7".
*   `Office 365 SharePoint Online`, `Microsoft Teams Templates Service`, `Office 365 Exchange Online`: Device is "Business and Industry Consulting @ Americas".

Looks good. I will now generate the JSON.

- All severity levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFORMATIONAL) are present.
- All failed operations are included (e.g., Abhishek Bhardwaj's failed user addition, nagavvss.kumar's failed SSPR).
- All sensitive operations (password changes, MFA updates, group changes) are included.
- Routine operations are at INFORMATIONAL level.
- At least one alert per user with activity is generated.
- `generated_at` is set to the latest timestamp from the logs for consistency.
- `log_type` is "Azure AD Audit".
- `total_users_analyzed` is 22.
- `confidence_score` is between 0-100.
- `correlation_ids` are exact matches.
- `ip_addresses` are lists of unique IPs.
- `device_info` is a comma-separated string of unique devices.
- `operation` is a comma-separated string of unique operations.
- `time_delta_seconds` is calculated correctly.
- `user` is "N/A" for service-initiated events.

The output looks comprehensive and adheres to all specified constraints.```json
